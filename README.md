# SQL_project

This project involves extracting data from a large dataset using SQL, and subsequently reading and visualizing this data from various sheets of an Excel file (sql_veriler.xlsx) using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The SQL query retrieves sales data by joining the Products and Suppliers tables to count the sales amount per supplier and company, grouping and ordering the results accordingly. Each sheet in the Excel file contains different types of data: Sheet1 provides sales data by company, Sheet2 includes employee count data, Sheet3 details product counts, Sheet4 summarizes customer orders and spending, Sheet5 tracks yearly total quantities and revenues, and Sheet6 compiles employee orders, quantities, and revenues. The project involves verifying the presence of expected columns in each sheet, sorting the data, and generating bar plots or line plots to visualize the relationships and trends within the data effectively.
